_If you clone the repo into your machine and use the config by copying .config/nvim to your home folder, wait for the plugins, language servers, and parsers to install with lazy.nvim, Mason, and nvim-treesitter. If you are opening a lua file or another file I have language servers configured for, like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript, you might also get an error saying that the server failed to start. This is because Mason hasn't installed it yet. Press enter to continue, Mason will automatically install it._

## Introduction

This Neovim configuration is based on the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) project, which serves as a starting point for creating a personalized setup. Kickstart.nvim is:

* Small
* Single-file
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

Ensure you have the latest ['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) or ['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) version of Neovim.

### Setup Requires

- True Color Terminal Like: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (Version 0.9 or Later)
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - I use Iosevka Nerd Font
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - For Telescope Fuzzy Finder
- XCode Command Line Tools
- If working with TypeScript/JavaScript and the TypeScript language server like me, you might need to install Node.

If you're on Mac, like me, you can install WezTerm, Neovim, Ripgrep, and Node with Homebrew.

```bash
brew install --cask ghostty
brew install neovim
brew install ripgrep
brew install node
```

For XCode Command Line Tools do:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```
That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use :Lazy to view the current plugin status. Hit q to close the window.
